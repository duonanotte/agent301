## Step 1: Preparation

   * Ensure that **`Python 3.10`** is installed | Installation guide for [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * Download and extract the archive or use the command
     
     ```
     git clone [REPOSITORY URL]
     ```
## Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

* For Windows:
  
     ```
  python -m venv venv
  venv/Scripts/activate
     ```
* For Linux:
    ```
  python3.10 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

* Navigate to the script folder:

   ```
   cd Agent301
   ```
* Install the required libraries:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 4: Create and Fill `.env` File

* In the terminal enter
  
     ```
    copy .env-example .env
     ```
* Enter the **API_ID** and **API_HASH** obtained from the [`https://my.telegram.org/auth`](#) website

## Step 5: Proxy Setup

* Fill in the `session_proxy.json` file, linking each account to a separate proxy.
* For automatic filling, add all your proxies to the `proxies.txt` file and name your sessions, for example, "1-Andrey", "2-John".
* In the terminal run the command
  
  ```
  python session_proxy_matcher.py
  ```
* The script will match each proxy line with the account number and add them to the `session_proxy.json` file. This way, you will have a ready-made file where the first proxy line corresponds to the first account, and so on.

## Step 6: Create Sessions or Use Existing Ones

   * To use existing sessions, add them to the `sessions` folder.
   * To create new sessions, select option "2" in the main menu of the program.

## Step 7: Run the script

   * Select option "1" in the main menu, and the script will start running.
